# Ajax-Http-Library
The library is truncated in order to make it easier to post, get, delete, put the data from the server using API.
For testing requests i used Fake Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping :fast_forward: [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

* GET	/posts
* GET	/posts/1
* POST	/posts
* PUT	/posts/1
* DELETE	/posts/1

> How to use?

In the app.js file i wrote example how to use this library. Instead of my fake REST API you must insert your API.

:heavy_exclamation_mark::heavy_exclamation_mark: If you see some problem or have idea how improve this library you can create pull request. :speech_balloon:

I will always be happy with new ideas.:blush:
